This will help you understand the role and the employer’s needs. Identify the skills and qualities they seek. You can usually find them in the responsibilities and qualifications sections.</p><p style=\"text-align:start\">Situation, Task, Action, Result, Skills/qualities you want to show.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:start\"><u>Bullet Point Examples</u></h2><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>GENERIC DESCRIPTION</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Public Health Society, Events Coordinator</p><ul><li><p>Responsible for organizing events and panels</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:start\">In this example, it is not clear what the candidate did to organize events and panels, what skills they used, or what kind of events and panels they organized.&nbsp;Because of this, the writer misses the chance to showcase the skills used to carry out this task.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>STRONG, CONCRETE DESCRIPTION</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Public Health Society, Events Coordinator</p><ul><li><p>Plan and coordinate panels on public health for audiences of 25–50 undergraduates on a bi-monthly basis</p></li><li><p>Identify and contact health professionals in the community to participate in panels</p></li><li><p>Create marketing materials and publicize events through social media</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:start\">In this example, the first bullet point clearly highlights organizational skills. It also&nbsp;lets the employer know the scope, target audience, and frequency of the events. This efficiently illustrates&nbsp;the candidate’s abilities and experience.</p><p style=\"text-align:start\">The second bullet point indicates research and interpersonal skills, which were used to secure panelists. It also demonstrates the ability to communicate with professionals outside of the university.</p><p style=\"text-align:start\">The third bullet highlights a specific business skill and/or the ability to be strategic in marketing, as well as familiarity with using social media for marketing purposes.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>ADDING ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND IMPACT:</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Employers review resumes to understand the impact you’ve&nbsp;had on a project, organization, or company. For instance:</p><ul><li><p>Were the materials and publicizing efforts successful?</p></li><li><p>Did these actions result in reaching a new group of students?</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:start\">Review each statement you’ve created for your resume. Can you add an accomplishment or achievement?&nbsp;What happened as a result of that action? How did it benefit the organization? You don’t&nbsp;need to add a result to every bullet point on your resume, but it’s helpful to demonstrate achievements when possible.</p><p style=\"text-align:start\">What does this look like? In the bullet point about marketing materials and social media, this might read:</p><ul><li><p>Create marketing materials and publicize events through social media. Increased attendance at several club programs by 75% (if you have an accurate figure)</p></li><li><p>Create marketing materials and publicize events through social media. Saw increased attendance at several club programs throughout the year (if you are unable to quantify)</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:start\">These statements combine the Action and Result sections of the STAR method.</p>",

        "title": "10 Tips for Improving Your Public Speaking Skills",
        "description": "<h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>1. Nervousness Is Normal. Practice and Prepare!</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">All people feel some physiological reactions like pounding hearts&nbsp;and trembling&nbsp;hands. Do not associate these feelings with the sense that you will perform poorly or make a fool of yourself. Some nerves are good. The adrenaline rush that makes you sweat also makes you more alert and ready to give your best performance.</p><p style=\"text-align:start\">The best way to overcome anxiety is to prepare, prepare, and prepare some more. Take the time to go over your notes several times. Once you have become comfortable with the material, practice—a lot. Videotape yourself, or get a friend to critique your performance.</p><p><a href=\"https://professional.dce.harvard.edu/programs/communication-strategies-presenting-with-impact/\">Communication Strategies: Presenting with Impact</a></p><p><a href=\"https://professional.dce.harvard.edu/communications-programs/\">Search all Communication programs.</a></p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>2. Know Your Audience. Your Speech Is About Them, Not You.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Before you begin to craft your message, consider who the message is intended for. Learn as much about your listeners as you can. This will help you determine your choice of words, level of information, organization pattern, and motivational statement.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>3. Organize Your Material in the Most Effective Manner to Attain Your Purpose.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Create the framework for your speech. Write down the topic, general purpose, specific purpose, central idea, and main points. Make sure to grab the audience’s attention in the first 30 seconds.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>4. Watch for Feedback and Adapt to It.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Keep the focus on the audience. Gauge their reactions, adjust your message, and stay flexible. Delivering a canned speech will guarantee that you lose the attention of or confuse even the most devoted listeners.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>5. Let Your Personality Come Through.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Be yourself, don’t become a talking head—in any type of communication. You will establish better credibility if your personality shines through, and your audience will trust what you have to say if they can see you as a real person.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>6. Use Humor, Tell Stories, and Use Effective Language.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Inject a funny anecdote in your presentation, and you will certainly grab your audience’s attention. Audiences generally like a personal touch in a speech. A story can provide that.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>7. Don’t Read Unless You Have to. Work from an Outline.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Reading from a script or slide fractures the interpersonal connection. By maintaining eye contact with the audience, you keep the focus on yourself and your message. A brief outline can serve to jog your memory and keep you on task.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>8. Use Your Voice and Hands Effectively. Omit Nervous Gestures.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Nonverbal communication carries most of the message. Good delivery does not call attention to itself, but instead conveys the speaker’s ideas clearly and without distraction.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>9. Grab Attention at the Beginning, and Close with a Dynamic End.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Do you enjoy hearing a speech start with “Today I’m going to talk to you about X”? Most people don’t. Instead, use a startling statistic, an interesting anecdote, or concise quotation. Conclude your speech with a summary and a strong statement that your audience is sure to remember.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:start\"><strong>10. Use Audiovisual Aids Wisely.</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align:start\">Too many can break the direct connection to the audience, so use them sparingly. They should enhance or clarify your content, or capture and maintain your audience’s attention.</p><h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Practice Does Not Make Perfect</h2><p style=\"text-align:start\">Good communication is never perfect, and nobody expects you to be perfect. However, putting in the requisite time to prepare will help you deliver a better speech. You may not be able to shake your nerves entirely, but you can learn to minimize them.</p>",
